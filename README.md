## Spam Filtering Email System


#### Tasks
- Step 1: Data Acquisition: Begin by accessing the Registry of Open Data on AWS or Kaggle to find suitable datasets for your project. Remember, the data you choose should be relevant to spam email classification. 

- Step 2: Model Development: Use Jupyter Notebook to develop your model. This should include the necessary data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training steps. 

- Step 3: Spam Email Classifiers: Develop and unit test your Spam Email Classifiers. You should create two separate Python applications - one that uses Logistic Regression and another that uses Linear Regression. Ensure your classifiers can accurately distinguish between spam and non-spam emails. 

- Step 4: Presentation: Finally, develop a 5-slide PowerPoint presentation that summarizes your work. Include your thought process, the challenges you faced, the solutions you implemented, and the results you achieved. Be ready to defend your approach and your results.
